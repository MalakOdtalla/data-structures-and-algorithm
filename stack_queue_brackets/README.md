## Approach & Efficiency
Depending on stack data strucure, I built a class with validate brackets method, 
the efficiency for this approch:

Big O:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)



## Solution
I Create function called validate brackets in class called validation that depends on Stack, this func takes a string as argument and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced.
