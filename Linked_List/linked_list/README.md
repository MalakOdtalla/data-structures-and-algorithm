The aim of this code challenge is to make a simple linked list. So the code depends on create a linkedlist as class, with 3 methods like:

- Insert: Adds a new node to the head of the list.
- Includes: Indicates whether specific value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- ToString: Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

- Includes: O(n)
- ToString: O(n)

## API
