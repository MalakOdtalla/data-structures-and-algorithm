# Challenge Summary
Function to change all values in the given tree according to fizz_buzz:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”

If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”

If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

## Approach & Efficiency
I take reursion approach, to solve this challenge with :

Time: O(n)

Space: O(n)
## Solution
define method takes binary tree as argument and return new tree with fizzbus
check if the nodes in tree dividable by 3 ,5, 3&5
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
