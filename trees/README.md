# Trees
A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value, a list of references to nodes (the “children”).
## Challenge
create a class called binary tree that has the functions to display the values through depth first traversals methods. Also the make a binary search tree class that extened the base binary tree. This class should have the methods of add and contains.
## Approach & Efficiency

Binary Tree

Orders: Time O(n) Space: O(n)

Binary Search Tree

Add: Time O(h) Space: O(1)

Contains: Time O(h) Space O(1)

## API
- Binary Tree:

Display methods(pre order,in order,post order): 

Input: None -> Output: List

- Binary Search Tree:

Add: Input Value -> Output: None

Contains: Input Value -> Output: True/False
